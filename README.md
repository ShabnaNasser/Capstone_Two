### HEALTHCARE PROVIDER FRAUD DETECTION ANALYSIS

The goal of this project is to predict the potentially fraudulent providers based on the claims filed by them. Along with this, we will also discover important variables helpful in detecting the behaviour of potentially fraud providers. Further, we will study fraudulent patterns in the provider's claims to understand the future behaviour of providers.

#### What is Healthcare Fraud?

Health care fraud is a type of white-collar crime that involves the filing of dishonest health care claims to turn a profit. Healthcare fraud can affect anyone from healthcare funds to fund members like us. It happens when someone like a healthcare provider or an individual provides false information or withholds the information to get a financial benefit. Types of frauds by providers are: i) Billing for services that were not provided. ii) Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service. iii) Misrepresenting the service provided. iv) Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was provided. v) Billing for a covered service when the service provided was not covered.

#### Business Problem: 

This case study aims to "predict the potentially fraudulent providers" based on the claims filed by them. Along with this, we will also discover important features helpful in detecting the behaviour of potentially fraudulent providers. Further, we will study fraudulent patterns in the provider's claims to understand the future behaviour of providers.

#### Machine Learning problem: 

We can project the above problem to a binary classification problem to find whether the provider is fraud or non-fraud. Using the claim details submitted by that provider.
